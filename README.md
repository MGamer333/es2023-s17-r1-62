### About the project ###

The first task was to create a teaser landing page for a fictional event named PopFest in The Castle. After that I created the full event page with the
informations and graphical designs to attract people. The final task was to make a tool with wich the admins can arrange seats. Double click for a new seat (you can rename it), drag-and-drop for moving. It features a saving, reload from file, export, and autosave.

Pre-landing page for the event: https://cocky-jennings-8df898.netlify.app/part1.html
